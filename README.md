 # üëã Hi there
 
I am Mateus Vicentin, graduated in Systems Analysis and Development. Currently, I am pursuing a postgraduate degree as a Data Engineer. I am passionate about the fields of Cybersecurity, Networks, Cloud, and Databases. In my free time, I enjoy playing computer games and listening to music that brightens my day.

# üöÄ Experience

I have experience in the field of networks, totaling 6 years in the field, ranging from technical support to infrastructure analyst. I have configured various types of equipment such as MikroTik routers, with some knowledge of Huawei and Cisco. I also have experience in the administration of Windows Active Directory servers, including server configuration and maintenance, as well as the creation of policy rules and other settings. I have some knowledge in firewall rules, both in software like PaloAlto, for example, and in rules for MikroTik devices.   

I enjoy taking on new challenges and learning about a specific subject up close and hands-on. I believe that the best way to learn is by doing what needs to be done.

Some of the main tasks I have performed over the years include:                                      
Provisioning SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS Virtual Machines in the VMware vCenter environment, installing Windows and Linux operating systems on virtual machines;
Configuring routing, firewall settings, directions, TCP/IP, and/or other protocols;        
Complete training of new technical support members and external technicians;
Monitoring incidents via Grafana and Zabbix and resolving the problem that occurred;
Creation of users, groups and GPOs and/or other procedures in the Windows Server Active Directory;
Activation of customer connections internally in the system used by the provider, following the Quality standards established by the company and assisting external technicians to follow these standards during installations and assistance;
Recording videos containing a specific configuration tutorial or some usability of the systems used by support members;
Updating and testing equipment, in order to ensure that it is ready to be installed in the customer's home;
Performing actions in the Data Center;
